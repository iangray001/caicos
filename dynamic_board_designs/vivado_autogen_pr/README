Ok, the system design that comes out of this script looks a little mental, this should help
to explain why it is the way that it is.

AXI_Interconnect_0 acts as a peripheral bus. As an optimisation, this can be converted from a crossbar
to a simple bus without much in the way of a performance detriment. This connects the control
signals for the reconfigurable partitions together, allows for control of the DMA core and 
other misc peripherals.

AXI_Interconnect_2 is effectively the memory bus. This should be kept as a crossbar. This allows
the reconfigurable partitions to access memory, and also allows the PCI express controller to
be able to read/write from RAM. This bus also connects to the PCI Express slave port. This is 
because the CDMA needs to be able to access memory and PCI Express.
- Consider creating a separate AXI bus for the CDMA to be able to access both memory
  and PCI Express later...

AXI_Interconnect_1 should be a small bus to enable the PCI-Express to talk to either the peripheral
bus (AXI0), or the memory bus (AXI2).

The connections of the CDMA aren't nice. This is because the master port needs to be clocked from
the PCI Express bus clock in order for the MSI interrupt to be synchronised correctly. If not,
some MSI interrupts may be missed. On the master side, the domain crossing would have to happen at one
point anyway in order to cause the domain crossing to the PCI-E slave.
