Quick note, to use this project with the kernel driver found in caicos/system_software/, you
need to modify the device-tree of the Linux kernel running on the Zynq PS. Adding these
lines should suffice to make it work correctly:

juniper@40000000 {
       compatible = "york,juniper-zynq-1.0";
       status = "okay";
       interrupt-parent = <0x3>;
       interrupts = <0x0 0x1D 0x4>;
       reg = <0x40000000 0x20000000 0x60000000 0x8000000>;
};
